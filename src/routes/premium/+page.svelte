  <p class="text-lg">
    Huge thanks for the free content QuickyBaby, I don't really play World of Tanks anymore
    because of this very document, but I still watch all of your videos as I really like your
    analytical side. If you want to include an updated version of this analysis next year,
    reach out to me at lukas@dreamplay.net and I'll sort out a new one.
